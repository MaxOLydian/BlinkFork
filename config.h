//here's a generic configuration header
//v1.2 NEWER VERSION!

//now I'll add some custom lines into my config file- I want them to stay in my local repository and not get
//pushed to BlinkFork
//(although sometimes I might!  If I worked on a new feature, for instance, that necessitated an addition to config.h)
//Damn, this gets confusing!
